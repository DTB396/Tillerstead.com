      Most “emergencies” aren’t surprises—they’re small problems that went
      unseen too long. A maintenance plan keeps you ahead of leaks, rot, loose
      fixtures, grout failures, caulk breakdown, and seasonal wear.

      <strong>Good fit for:</strong> homeowners who want a reliable person to
      keep the property stable—without chasing contractors for every small fix.

      <li>
        <strong>Baseline walk-through:</strong> we identify priority items,

        <strong>Small repairs handled:</strong> minor fixes are addressed
        on-site when possible; larger work is quoted separately.
