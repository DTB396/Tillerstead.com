        <strong>Important:</strong> Tile products are not “mix-and-match” by
        default. Many waterproofing assemblies require compatible accessories
        (banding, corners, drain parts) from the same system. If you’re unsure,
        choose a complete system and follow the manufacturer’s method—then
        verify substrate readiness before tile.

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Do affiliate links increase my cost?</strong></dt>
        <dd>No. Pricing is the same; Amazon pays the commission.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Are these the exact products you use?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Often, yes—especially tools. For materials (mortar/membrane/grout), we
          sometimes source locally for speed and freshness. Always confirm the
          current data sheet and system requirements for your application.

          >
        </dt>
        <dd>
          No. Compliance and performance depend on using the right product for
          the application and installing it correctly— including substrate prep,
          detailing, and verification—per current manufacturer instructions.
