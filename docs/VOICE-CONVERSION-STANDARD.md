**Scope:** All copy, CTA, metadata, and microcopy across Tillerstead.com

---

## Executive Summary

Tillerstead LLC serves practical New Jersey homeowners who value code compliance, durability, and transparent communication over marketing hype. This standard defines the voice, tone, and conversion principles for all customer-facing copy to maximize clarity, trust, and action while maintaining strict compliance and factual accuracy.

**Target Persona: The Practical NJ Homeowner**
- Licensed, code-aware, prefers substance over promises
- Wants clear scope, honest timelines, and durable work
- Fears hidden costs, vague contractors, and future rework
- Values documentation, cleanliness, and professional communication
- Decision-drivers: technical rigor, insurance/warranty clarity, local understanding

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. **Professional, Grounded, Competent**
- Lead with credentials (NJ HIC #13VH10808800) and TCNA/ANSI standards.
- Show competence through specifics: "1/8\" substrate flatness per TCNA EJ171," not "perfectly flat."
- Avoid marketing adjectives: "best," "perfect," "never fails," "top-rated."
- Use measured language: "designed for," "tested for," "built to," "meets or exceeds."

**Example:**
- ❌ "We provide the best tile work in South Jersey."
- ✅ "TCNA-compliant installations verified by substrate flatness testing and flood-tested waterproofing."

### 2. **Clear Scope & Process**
- Always explain what you *do* and what you *don't.*
- Define roles: "We handle tile & waterproofing; plumbing and cabinetry are separate trades."
- Explain workflow: estimation → prep → waterproofing → installation → documentation → closeout.
- No vague promises; be honest about what depends on site conditions.

**Example:**
- ❌ "We'll handle everything."
- ✅ "Tile, waterproofing, finish carpentry, and paint. Plumbing, electrical, and cabinetry remain your GC's responsibility."

### 3. **Clean Process & Respect**
- Emphasize substrate prep, waterproofing, protection, and cleanup.
- Highlight daily HEPA vacuuming, dust barriers, and photo documentation.
- Explain that "doing it right" takes time: "4–8 weeks out to avoid rushing critical phases."
- Show respect for the home: "We work in occupied homes with daily cleanup and minimal disruption."

**Example:**
- ❌ "Quick turnaround guaranteed."
- ✅ "4–8 week lead times reflect the time needed for substrate prep, waterproofing cure, and precision tile setting. We refuse to rush."

### 4. **Code & Inspection Awareness**
- Reference NJ HIC regulations, TCNA Handbook, ANSI standards, and IBC/IRC.
- Explain *why* compliance matters: "Protects you from code violations, insurance claims, and future liability."
- Avoid legal advice; keep compliance statements neutral and factual.
- Always suggest: "Verify your contractor's credentials at [official authority]."

**Example:**
- ❌ "We follow all regulations."
- ✅ "All work meets 2024 TCNA Handbook, ANSI A108/A118, and 2018 IBC/IRC. We verify NJ HIC status at njconsumeraffairs.gov."

### 5. **Short Paragraphs, Bullets, Plain English**
- Limit paragraphs to 2–3 sentences.
- Use bullets for processes, checklists, and feature lists.
- Define jargon once; assume homeowner knowledge from there.
- Minimize acronyms; spell out on first mention: "TCNA (Tile Council of North America)."

**Example:**
- ❌ "The employment of substrate-preparation protocols consistent with TCNA EJ171 ensures optimal adhesion and longevity."
- ✅ "Substrate prep follows TCNA EJ171: we measure flatness, correct issues, and document before thinset application."

### 6. **Durability Signals**
- Emphasize substrate prep, waterproofing, protection, and post-project documentation.
- Highlight movement joints, proper slope, sealing, and thermal testing where applicable.
- Show that durability is intentional, not accidental: "Prepped, tested, documented."

**Example:**
- ❌ "Built to last."
- ✅ "Substrate prep verified to ±1/8\" in 10', waterproofing flood-tested, movement joints at all changes of plane, grout sealed with premium penetrating sealer."

### 7. **No Political, Religious, or Sovereign-Citizen Framing**
- Keep all copy neutral on politics, religion, and legal status.
- Refer to "NJ regulations," "code compliance," "NJ HIC licensing" — never "constitutional rights" or religious messaging.
- Avoid patriotic appeals or lifestyle politics.

## CTA & Conversion Rules

### Primary CTAs
Format: **[Specific Action] + [Reassurance]**

**High-Traffic Pages (Home, Services, Contact, Reviews):**
- "Request an Estimate" (not "Get a Free Quote")
- "Schedule a Site Visit" (not "Book Now")
- "Describe Your Project" (on contact form)
- "Call (609) 862-8808" (direct and phone-forward)

**Reasoning:** "Request" and "Schedule" convey professional engagement; "free" commodifies; specificity (site visit, estimate) reduces friction.

### Secondary CTAs
- "View Testimonials on Thumbtack" (third-party proof)
- "Download NJ Tile Guide" (lead magnet + education)
- "Explore Portfolio" (visual proof)
- "Contact for GC Pricing" (B2B variant)

### CTA Copy Patterns
**Estimate/Proposal:**
- ✅ "Request an Estimate"
- ✅ "Get a Written Scope & Timeline"
- ✅ "Upload Project Photos for a Free Proposal"
- ❌ "Get Pricing Instantly"
- ❌ "Free Quote in 24 Hours"

**Contact:**
- ✅ "Request a Scope Review"
- ✅ "Describe Your Project"
- ✅ "Schedule a Site Visit"
- ❌ "Message Us"
- ❌ "Get Help Now"

**Reassurance Language in/Near CTA:**
- "Licensed NJ HIC contractor"
- "All proposals include detailed scope, timeline, and transparent pricing"
- "We provide written estimates within 3–5 business days"
- "Calls/texts returned same day"

---

## Claim Substantiation Rules

### No Fabricated Facts
**Never add:**
- Years of experience (unless already stated in repo)
- Awards, certifications, or ratings (unless independently verified)
- Testimonials that are not from repo or third-party platforms (Thumbtack, Google)
- Guarantees like "best," "#1," "most trusted," "perfect work"
- Specific numbers (e.g., "100+ projects") unless already documented

### Substantiation Hierarchy
1. **NJ HIC License & Credentials** → Always verifiable; prioritize
2. **TCNA/ANSI/IBC/IRC Standards** → Published, public standards; safe to cite
3. **Processes & Workflow** → Describe what *is* done; avoid promises about outcomes
4. **Pricing Ranges** → Only if already in repo (e.g., pricing.html)
5. **Testimonials** → Only from Thumbtack or verified third-party sources
6. **Process Timelines** → "4–8 weeks" is already established; do not shorten or guarantee

### When In Doubt
- **Remove or neutralize** the claim rather than strengthen it.
- Use hedging language: "designed to," "intended to prevent," "helps reduce risk."
- Point to third-party authority: "Verify contractor credentials at [URL]."
- Shift from outcome to process: instead of "We prevent leaks," say "We install per ANSI A118.10 flood-test methods."

**Examples:**
- ❌ "We never have leaks." → ✅ "Our waterproofing installations meet ANSI A118.10 and are flood-tested before tile setting."
- ❌ "We're the most trusted contractor in South Jersey." → ✅ "Verified testimonials and ratings available on Thumbtack."
- ❌ "Your project will be done in 3 weeks." → ✅ "Typical tile/waterproofing projects: 4–8 weeks. Lead times reflect substrate prep, cure time, and precision work."

## Before/After Microcopy Examples

### Messaging Pattern: Process Clarity

**Before:**
"Professional Tile Installation. Expert Waterproofing. Licensed & Insured."

**After:**
"Substrate flatness verified, waterproofing flood-tested, every step documented. TCNA-compliant, NJ HIC licensed, fully insured."

*Why:* Specificity (flatness testing, flood-tested) proves expertise; process (documented) signals professionalism.

---

### Messaging Pattern: Risk Reduction

**Before:**
"Avoid costly mistakes. Trust the experts."

**After:**
"Written scope & change orders prevent surprise costs. Daily photo logs protect your insurance claim. Warranty documentation is yours to keep."

*Why:* Concrete benefit (written scope = no surprises) beats emotional appeal (trust us); specific outcome (insurance protection) is stronger than generic benefit (avoid mistakes).

---

### Messaging Pattern: Compliance as Conversion

**Before:**
"We follow NJ codes and TCNA standards."

**After:**
"All work meets 2024 TCNA Handbook, ANSI A118.10, and 2018 IBC/IRC—protecting you from code violations and insurance liability. NJ HIC #13VH10808800."

*Why:* Specific standards (with years) show depth; explicit benefit (liability protection) resonates with homeowners; HIC # is verifiable proof.

---

### Messaging Pattern: Durability Proof

**Before:**
"Built to last."

**After:**
"Substrate prep verified to ±1/8\" in 10' (TCNA EJ171), waterproofing flood-tested, movement joints at all changes of plane, grout sealed. We document every step."

*Why:* Specific methods (flatness spec, flood test, movement joints) prove intentional durability; documentation signals ongoing support.

---

### Messaging Pattern: CTA Clarity

**Before:**
"Get a Free Estimate"

**After:**
"Request an Estimate" (with copy: "Upload 5 site photos. Receive a detailed written scope, timeline, and transparent pricing—no jargon, no surprises.")

*Why:* "Request" implies professional engagement; specifics (photos, scope, timeline) reduce friction; explicit commitment (written proposal) builds trust.

---

### Messaging Pattern: Scope Boundaries

**Before:**
"Full-Service Remodeling"

**After:**
"Tile Installation, Waterproofing, Finish Carpentry & Paint. Plumbing, electrical, cabinetry, and HVAC are coordinated separately. Detailed written scope defines roles."

*Why:* Clarity on what's included (tile, waterproofing) and excluded (plumbing, electrical) prevents scope creep; "written scope" emphasizes transparency.

## Metadata & SEO Guidelines

### Page Title Format
**[Service/Topic] | [Location or Benefit] | Tillerstead LLC**

Examples:
- ✅ "Waterproof Showers | TCNA-Compliant Installation | South Jersey | Tillerstead LLC"
- ✅ "Tile Installation & Waterproofing in Atlantic County | Tillerstead LLC"

- ✅ "Property maintenance plans for South Jersey homeowners. Licensed, documented, predictable. Monthly inspections and minor repairs by NJ HIC #13VH10808800."

### Keyword Strategy
- **Primary:** "TCNA-compliant," "NJ HIC licensed," "waterproof showers," "tile installation"
- **Secondary:** County names (Atlantic, Ocean, Cape May), specific towns (Galloway, Egg Harbor), service types (bathroom remodel, backsplash)
- **Avoid:** Superlatives (best, #1, top-rated), made-up stats (100+ projects, 20 years), unverified reviews

### OpenGraph Tags
- **og:title:** Same as page title
- **og:description:** Same as meta description (or slightly shorter)
- **og:image:** Portfolio image, process photo, or team photo (contextual)
- **og:url:** Absolute URL to page

---

## Content Section Standards

### Hero Sections
- **Eyebrow:** Descriptive label (e.g., "Services," "About," "Process") or benefit phrase (e.g., "Tile That Survives South Jersey")
- **Title:** Benefit-forward, specific. Avoid: "Welcome to Tillerstead." Use: "TCNA-Compliant Tile & Waterproofing That Lasts."
- **Summary:** 1–2 sentences explaining service + credential or process. End with CTA link or implication.
- **KPIs:** 2–3 bullets with measurable/specific proof (e.g., "NJ HIC #13VH10808800," "4–8 week lead times," "Flood-tested waterproofing").

### Service Descriptions
- **H2 Heading:** Service name or outcome (e.g., "Waterproof Showers," "Bathroom Remodeling")
- **Intro Paragraph:** Benefit + scope (e.g., "Waterproof showers rated for 10+ years by ANSI A118.10 flood-test methods. Includes prefab niche, sloped pan, and full membrane installation.")
- **Bullet List:** 3–5 specific features or methods
- **CTA:** "Request an Estimate" or service-specific action

### Process Sections
- **Step Sequence:** Scope → Prep → Build → Test/Document → Closeout
- **Descriptive Language:** What happens, why it matters
- **Avoid:** Timeline promises (use established ranges: "4–8 weeks")
- **Include:** Risk mitigation (e.g., "Daily HEPA vacuuming protects occupied homes")

### Testimonials
- **Source:** Only Thumbtack, Google, or verified third-party platform
- **Format:** Name, location, service, quote, link to verifier
- **No fabrication:** Never create hypothetical or paraphrased testimonials
- **Filtering:** Emphasize code-compliance, professionalism, and durability themes

### Pricing
- **Ranges Only:** Display range (e.g., "$3,500–$5,500") if already in repo
- **Disclaimer:** "Pricing varies by scope, materials, and site conditions. Request an estimate for accurate pricing."
- **Transparency:** Always link to detailed estimate/proposal CTA

---

## Style Guidelines

### Language
- **Acronyms:** Spell out on first mention (e.g., "TCNA (Tile Council of North America)"), then use shorthand
- **Jargon:** Define once; assume continued understanding ("waterproofing" after first definition needs no re-explanation)
- **Tone:** Professional, direct, no filler
- **Contractions:** Use ("we're," "it's") for conversational warmth
- **Active Voice:** "We measure substrate flatness" instead of "Substrate flatness is measured"

### Formatting
- **Headings:** H1 for page title, H2 for section, H3 for subsection. Use semantic hierarchy.
- **Paragraphs:** 2–3 sentences max. Break longer content into bullets.
- **Bullets:** Use for steps, features, checklists. Introduce with a context sentence.
- **Links:** Anchor text is descriptive ("Request an Estimate," "View Thumbtack Profile"), not "click here"
- **Emphasis:** Bold for key terms or credentials; italics rarely needed

### Avoid
- Marketing fluff: "We're passionate about," "We're committed to excellence"
- Filler words: "really," "very," "quite," "incredibly"
- Vague claims: "top-tier," "world-class," "cutting-edge"
- Exclamation marks (except CTAs): Use periods and specificity instead
