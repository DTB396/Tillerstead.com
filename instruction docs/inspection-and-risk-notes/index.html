  <h1 id="inspection-and-risk-notes">Inspection and Risk Notes</h1>

<p>Use this reference to coordinate inspections, reduce liability, and document performance milestones for true curbless showers. Requirements vary by jurisdiction—verify locally before scheduling inspections or sign-offs.</p>

<h2 id="slope-verification-concepts">Slope verification concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Record the designed slope rate (typically 1/4 in. per ft.) and measure the finished mortar bed with a digital level or laser before waterproofing.</li>
  <li>Document the longest run, required drop, and actual readings at a minimum of four quadrants.</li>
  <li>Include photos of measurement devices in place to confirm that the zero-threshold entry remains flush while maintaining the downhill plane.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="drain-performance-considerations">Drain performance considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Confirm the drain body and strainer are free of debris before flood testing; photograph exposed weep holes or troughs.</li>
  <li>Note the trap primer or venting method if required locally, and test for adequate flow by briefly removing the test plug and observing draw-down.</li>
  <li>Keep manufacturer data sheets on site to show the drain is listed for the intended membrane type and flow rating.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="waterproofing-continuity-risks">Waterproofing continuity risks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Inspect transitions between horizontal and vertical planes for reinforced seams; flag any field-fabricated penetrations for patching before tile work.</li>
  <li>Avoid mixing primers, sealants, or seam tapes from different systems without written approval.</li>
  <li>Track cure times and environmental conditions in daily reports so inspectors can verify compliance with manufacturer requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="water-migration-at-zero-threshold-entries">Water migration at zero-threshold entries</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Use straightedges to confirm the dry-side floor back-slopes away from the shower by at least 1/16 in. per ft., or maintain perfectly flat transitions protected by the continuous waterproof membrane.</li>
  <li>Provide drainage paths or concealed pans under door tracks when glass is specified; sealant alone is not a water stop.</li>
  <li>Note any nearby electrical or wood finishes that could be affected by incidental splash and document the protection method.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="flood-test-documentation-value">Flood-test documentation value</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain a flood-test log (see template) capturing fill height, start/stop times, ambient conditions, and inspector sign-offs when required.</li>
  <li>Mark the waterline with tape or pencil at multiple walls so any drop is visible; photograph before and after draining.</li>
  <li>Retain copies of test results and related photos with the project closeout packet to defend against future moisture claims.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="photo-documentation-checklist">Photo documentation checklist</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Exposed framing or slab after demolition, showing recess modifications.</li>
  <li>Mortar bed screeds and control lines prior to troweling.</li>
  <li>Waterproofing coverage at the entry, drain flange, and each corner.</li>
  <li>Flood test setup with gauge or tape measure confirming water depth.</li>
  <li>Post-test images of the dry surface and drain assembly prior to tile.</li>
  <li>Final finished floor showing flush transition and installed fixtures.</li>
</ol>

<p>Label all photos with date, location, and reference number tied to daily reports or inspection logs.</p>
