<p><strong>What “true curbless” means</strong><br />
A true curbless shower keeps the bathroom floor level at the entry while the shower floor gently slopes all the way to the drain, so there is no step or curb to cross.</p>

<p><strong>Why slope and waterproofing matter</strong><br />
The consistent slope keeps water moving to the drain, and the waterproofing underneath covers the entire shower area (and a bit of the dry floor) so splashes cannot reach the structure below.</p>

<p><strong>How this approach reduces long-term risk</strong><br />
By combining the right drain, waterproofing, and tile installation as one system, we protect framing, prevent mold-friendly moisture pockets, and make maintenance easier over the life of the bathroom.</p>

<p>All measurements are verified on site, and planning calculators are used only as guidance—final decisions come from field conditions and local inspectors.</p>
