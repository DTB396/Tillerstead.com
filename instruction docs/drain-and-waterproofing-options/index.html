<p>This guide outlines drain assemblies and waterproofing systems commonly used for true curbless showers. Select components as an integrated system and verify manufacturer instructions along with local plumbing approvals.</p>

<h2 id="drain-types">Drain types</h2>

<h3 id="bonding-flange-point-drains">Bonding-flange point drains</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Integrated flange accepts sheet or liquid membranes without clamping hardware.</li>
  <li>Ideal for single-plane mortar beds because the membrane can be bonded directly and carried continuously to the entry.</li>
  <li>Requires precise elevation control so tile thickness finishes flush with the grate frame.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clamping-ring-drains">Clamping-ring drains</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy two- or three-piece bodies that mechanically clamp the membrane between rings.</li>
  <li>Work well with traditionally floated pans where the primary waterproof layer sits below a setting bed; maintain clean weep paths.</li>
  <li>Ensure the membrane type is rated for mechanical compression and protect bolt penetrations with sealant compatible with the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linear-drains-contextual-use">Linear drains (contextual use)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Used when design calls for a single-direction slope or when the drain must sit near the entry; confirm recessed framing can handle the elongated body.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to outlet placement, strainer maintenance access, and the need for higher flow rates from multiple shower heads.</li>
  <li>Coordinate grate width and finish with adjacent floor coverings to maintain the zero-threshold transition.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="waterproofing-approaches">Waterproofing approaches</h2>

<h3 id="sheet-membranes">Sheet membranes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Provide uniform thickness and predictable perm ratings; seams are overlapped or seamed using manufacturer banding.</li>
  <li>Pair naturally with bonding-flange drains but can also interface with clamping drains using preformed collars.</li>
  <li>Require careful inside/outside corner treatment and diligent substrate prep to avoid telegraphing defects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="liquid-applied-membranes">Liquid-applied membranes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Useful for complex geometries and for tying into existing substrates; apply in alternating directions to reach specified mil thickness.</li>
  <li>Need curing verification before flood testing; record batch numbers and wet-film thickness readings.</li>
  <li>Use reinforcing fabric at plane changes, penetrations, and along the zero-threshold entry to handle foot traffic stresses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compatibility-considerations">Compatibility considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thinset categories:</strong> Match mortar type (ANSI A118 series) to both the membrane and tile; rapid-setting mortars may be restricted over some liquid membranes.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement at changes of plane:</strong> Embed fabric or preformed corners where the slope meets walls, benches, or glass channels.</li>
  <li><strong>Single-system consistency:</strong> Avoid mixing primers, membranes, and drains from unrelated manufacturers unless a written approval or tested assembly is provided.</li>
  <li><strong>Thermal and structural movement:</strong> Include soft joints or movement accommodation profiles at perimeters and transitions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practical-selection-criteria">Practical selection criteria</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Choose drains and membranes that suit the room layout, joist spacing, and transition requirements without introducing abrupt plane changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance expectations:</strong> Provide clean-out access, removable grates, and inspectable weep channels to support long-term service.</li>
  <li><strong>Sequencing and access:</strong> Confirm that slab recesses, blocking, and plumbing rough-ins are complete before membranes arrive on site; schedule flood testing before enclosure glass or finishes limit visibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify locally:</strong> Local code officials may require listed drains, specific test durations, or inspector presence during flood tests; document approvals in the project file.</li>
</ul>
