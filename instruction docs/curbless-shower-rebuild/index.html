  <h1 id="curbless-shower-rebuild-reference">Curbless Shower Rebuild Reference</h1>

<p>This document provides a field-ready sequence for constructing a true curbless (zero-threshold) shower and supporting planning equations suitable for estimator or calculator tools. Calculations are planning aids only; verify all measurements and code requirements on site.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>True curbless / zero-threshold:</strong> A shower floor that maintains a continuous slope (target 1/4 in. per ft.) from the dry-side entry to the drain while keeping the finished bathroom floor flush at the transition, with waterproofing extending under the entire sloped plane.</li>
  <li><strong>Recessed-entry / barrier-reduced:</strong> A shower area that lowers the structural or mortar build-up near the entry to soften the transition but still requires a minor bevel or trim piece; used when full flushness cannot be achieved without structural modification.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-by-step-build-sequence">Step-by-step build sequence</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Selective demolition and substrate exposure</strong><br />
Remove finishes down to sound framing or concrete, extending past the planned wet area so adjoining flooring can be feathered.</li>
  <li><strong>Framing or recess strategy (when required)</strong><br />
Notch or lower joists only when structurally approved, or install engineered recess systems to gain depth without compromising load paths; reinforce sistered members as specified.</li>
  <li><strong>Subfloor prep and flatness verification</strong><br />
Check the exposed deck with straightedges; correct deflection, delamination, or fastener withdrawal before introducing slope.</li>
  <li><strong>Slope planning and calculations</strong><br />
Confirm drain location, measure the longest run to the entry, and document required drop using the equations below; mark perimeter control lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Mortar-bed floating and shaping</strong><br />
Place bonded or unbonded deck mud per substrate requirements, keeping minimum thickness at the drain per manufacturer instructions and striking planes to the marked elevations.</li>
  <li><strong>Waterproofing installation (continuous plane)</strong><br />
Extend sheet or liquid membrane beneath the entire sloped area and at least 12 in. into the dry zone; overlap seams per system specs and embed reinforcing at all changes of plane.</li>
  <li><strong>Drain integration and membrane termination</strong><br />
Match the drain body to the membrane type (e.g., bonding flange with sheet membrane); clamp, bond, or weld per system requirements and protect weep pathways.</li>
  <li><strong>Flood testing and documentation</strong><br />
Plug the drain, fill to the highest perimeter point, record start/stop times, waterline marks, and photo evidence; maintain a minimum 24-hour dwell or local requirement (verify locally).</li>
  <li><strong>Tile installation and movement accommodation</strong><br />
Use thinset compatible with the membrane, maintain trowel orientation downhill, honor soft joints at perimeters, and coordinate transitions to adjacent flooring.</li>
  <li><strong>Final inspection and quality verification</strong><br />
Confirm slope with digital level readings, verify flush entry, document drain operation, and log waterproofing lot numbers or approvals for closeout.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="planning-equations">Planning equations</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Required drop (inches):</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drop_in = distance_to_drain_ft × slope_rate_in_per_ft</code></li>
  <li><strong>Perimeter elevation (inches):</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perimeter_height_in = drain_flange_height_in + drop_in</code></li>
  <li><strong>Average mortar-bed thickness (inches):</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avg_thickness_in = (drain_thickness_in + perimeter_thickness_in) ÷ 2</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">distance_to_drain_ft</code>: longest run from entry to drain center (ft)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slope_rate_in_per_ft</code>: commonly 0.25 in./ft.; adjust only when permitted by design professional</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drain_flange_height_in</code>: finished height at drain connection (including membrane build)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perimeter_thickness_in</code>: planned mortar height at the farthest point</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Calculators must flag that outputs are preliminary; adjust for framing deflection, tile thickness, and manufacturer minimums before installation.</p>

<h2 id="common-failure-conditions">Common failure conditions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Flat floors where slope was assumed but never verified with measurements or flood tests.</li>
  <li>Sudden plane changes or improvised ramps at entries that trap water or create trip hazards.</li>
  <li>Interrupted or patchworked waterproofing that leaves joints, seams, or penetrations unsealed.</li>
  <li>Mixing drains and membranes that are not designed to work together, resulting in delamination or clogged weep channels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always verify structural allowances, plumbing approvals, and inspection criteria with the local authority before work proceeds.</p>
