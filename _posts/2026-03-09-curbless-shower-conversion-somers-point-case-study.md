# Curbless Shower Conversion: Somers Point, NJ Before & After

**Project Location:** Somers Point, NJ (Atlantic County)  
**Completion Date:** February 2026  
**Project Duration:** 12 days  
**Project Type:** Curbless shower conversion + accessibility upgrades

---

## Project Overview

When Patricia contacted us about converting her mother's traditional shower to a barrier-free design, she had one clear priority: **"Mom needs to stay in her home safely."**

Her 78-year-old mother was recovering from hip surgery and struggling with the 6-inch curb on the existing shower. The choice was either move to assisted living or renovate for accessibility.

This case study covers the complete conversion: existing shower removal, floor lowering, linear drain installation, grab bar reinforcement, and modern ADA-compliant design.

---

## The Problem

### Existing Bathroom Issues

**Safety Hazards:**
- ❌ 6-inch curb (trip hazard, difficult to step over)
- ❌ No grab bars (nothing to hold during entry/exit)
- ❌ Slippery floor (large 12x12 tile with minimal texture)
- ❌ Fixed showerhead only (difficult to use seated)
- ❌ Narrow 32-inch door (tight for walker/wheelchair)

**Design Limitations:**
- ❌ Builder-grade 1990s shower (fiberglass pan, beige tile)
- ❌ No bench or seating
- ❌ Poor lighting (single overhead fixture)
- ❌ Inadequate ventilation

**Family Concerns:**
- Fall risk (mom fell once getting out of shower)
- Independence (needs help with bathing)
- Future-proofing (potential wheelchair use)
- Home value (renovation vs. selling)

### Building Code Challenges

**Curbless showers in existing homes face unique hurdles:**

**Problem #1: Floor Height**
- Existing floor joist height = 10 inches
- Curbless drain requires 3-4 inches depth
- **Solution:** Lower shower floor area OR raise bathroom floor

**Problem #2: Slope Requirements**
- Curbless shower: 1/4" per foot slope to drain
- Bathroom floor: Transition must be < 1/2" vertical (ADA)
- **Challenge:** Blending shower slope with flat bathroom floor

**Problem #3: Water Containment**
- No curb = potential flooding
- **Solution:** Proper slope + glass panel + correct drain placement

---

## Client Goals

**Must-Haves:**
1. Zero-threshold entry (completely level)
2. Wheelchair accessible (36" minimum clear width)
3. Grab bars strategically placed
4. Built-in bench (transfer surface)
5. Handheld shower (seated bathing)

**Nice-to-Haves:**
1. Modern, spa-like aesthetic (not "institutional")
2. Increased lighting
3. Higher ventilation (reduce humidity)
4. Easy-to-clean surfaces

**Budget:** $18,000 (client's insurance covered $5,000 for medical necessity)

**Timeline:** 2 weeks maximum (mom staying with daughter during work)

---

## Design Solution

### Accessibility Strategy

**ADA Compliance Elements:**
- Curbless entry (0" threshold)
- 60" x 30" shower footprint (wheelchair turning radius)
- Fold-down bench (transfer seat, weight-rated 250 lbs)
- Grab bars at entry, bench, and control wall
- Handheld shower on slide bar (adjustable height)
- Lever-handle controls (easier than knobs)

**Safety Features:**
- Slip-resistant tile (R11 rating)
- Linear drain (no center drain to step on)
- Contrasting grout (visual aid for slope)
- Recessed niches (no protruding shelves to hit)
- Enhanced lighting (LED recessed + shower-specific)

### Floor Modification Approach

**Option A: Lower Shower Floor** (CHOSEN)
- Remove existing shower pan
- Cut/lower floor joists in shower area
- Install recessed drain base
- Build up transition to bathroom floor
- **Pros:** Minimal bathroom floor disturbance
- **Cons:** Structural work, permit required

**Option B: Raise Entire Bathroom Floor**
- Build up entire bathroom 3-4 inches
- Match existing shower height
- Level transition at door
- **Pros:** No joist cutting
- **Cons:** New toilet flange, door trim, vanity affected

**Why we chose Option A:**
- Less disruptive to bathroom
- Lower cost ($2,800 vs. $4,200)
- Maintains ceiling height
- Preserves existing fixtures outside shower

### Material Selections

**Tile:**
- Floor: 12" x 24" porcelain (gray, matte, slip-resistant R11)
- Walls: 3" x 12" subway tile (white, matte finish)
- Accent: Marble mosaic (niche border, horizontal band)

**Fixtures:**
- **Kohler Memoirs:** Thermostatic valve (anti-scald, required for elderly)
- **Delta Faucet:** Handheld on slide bar + rain head (dual shower)
- **Moen Home Care:** Fold-down bench (18" x 14", wall-mounted)
- **Grab-Bar.com:** 1.25" diameter grab bars (ADA compliant, 300 lb rated)

**Accessibility Products:**
- **Schluter Kerdi-Shower-SB:** Curbless shower base kit
- **Schluter Kerdi-Line:** 48" linear drain (brushed stainless)
- **Schluter Kerdi-Board-SN:** Integrated bench structure

**Finishes:**
- Brushed nickel hardware (less slippery than chrome when wet)
- White grout (high contrast for visual aid)
- LED lighting (daylight spectrum, 5000K)

---

## Timeline & Process

### Week 1: Demo & Structural (Days 1-6)

**Day 1: Demolition**
- Removed existing fiberglass shower pan
- Demolished tile walls
- Exposed floor joists
- **Discovery:** Floor joists only 8" (not 10" as expected) - required deeper cut

**Day 2: Structural Modifications**
- Cut and lowered 3 floor joists in shower area
- Installed 2x10 headers for support
- Reinforced adjacent joists
- Building inspector approval (rough-in)

**Day 3: Plumbing Rough-In**
- Relocated drain to linear drain location (front of shower)
- Installed Schluter Kerdi-Line drain base
- Moved shower valve to accessible height (38" - wheelchair reach)
- Added dedicated vent line

**Day 4: Blocking & Reinforcement**
- Installed 2x8 blocking for all grab bar locations:
  - Entry grab bar (horizontal, 33-36" height)
  - Bench grab bar (vertical + horizontal L-shape)
  - Control wall grab bar (vertical, near valve)
- Added blocking for fold-down bench (16" on center studs)
- Installed blocking for recessed niches (2 locations)

**Day 5: Substrate Installation**
- Schluter Kerdi-Board (walls) - waterproof, no cement board needed
- Schluter Kerdi-Board-SN (integrated bench structure)

### Week 2: Tile & Finishing (Days 7-12)

**Day 7-8: Floor Slope & Transition**
- Built mortar slope (1/4" per foot to linear drain)
- Created gradual transition to bathroom floor (< 1/2" change per ADA)
- Installed Schluter Ditra (uncoupling membrane on transition area)

**Day 9: Flood Test**
- 24-hour flood test (2" water depth minimum)
- **Result:** Zero leaks (critical for curbless - water goes everywhere)
- Photos for building department
- Inspector approval

**Day 10: Tile Installation**
- Floor tile: 12x24 porcelain (installed with minimal grout lines)
- Transition area: Same tile, perfect blend
- Slope verified with level (1/4" per foot maintained)

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge #1: Insufficient Floor Joist Depth

**Problem:** Existing joists measured 8 inches (not 10" as assumed from plans). Linear drain required 3.5" depth minimum.

**Solution:**
1. Cut joists 4.5 inches deep (within engineering limits)
2. Installed double 2x10 headers for lateral support
3. Added sister joists to adjacent members
4. **Cost:** +$240 (materials) + 4 hours labor
5. **Benefit:** Maintained structural integrity, passed inspection

**Lesson:** Always verify actual dimensions before quoting curbless conversions. Floor depth varies even in same neighborhood.

### Challenge #2: Drain Placement for Wheelchair Access

**Problem:** Initial design placed linear drain at back of shower. Wheelchair users can't easily reach back wall (can't turn around in 60x30 space).

**Solution:**
- Moved drain to front of shower (near entry)
- Sloped floor from back to front
- **Benefit:** Wheelchair rolls straight in, user stays in chair near front
- **Learning:** ADA compliance isn't just measurements—it's thinking through actual use

### Challenge #3: Water Migration (No Curb)

**Problem:** During flood test, water migrated under bathroom door (12 feet away).

**Solution:**
1. Increased slope angle (went to 1/3" per foot in first 24")
2. Added slight "valley" at transition (subtle dip, then rise)
3. Installed 24" glass panel at entry (partial barrier)
4. **Result:** Water contained within shower + 6" radius

**Note:** Curbless showers WILL get water on bathroom floor. Client educated on:
- Bath mat required
- Quick squeegee after use
- Enhanced ventilation needed

### Challenge #4: Bench Weight Rating Verification

**Problem:** Client's mother weighs 180 lbs. Standard fold-down benches rated for 250 lbs, but must account for transfer forces (sitting down = 1.5x weight impact).

**Solution:**
- Upgraded to Moen Home Care model (500 lb rating)
- Installed into double 2x8 blocking (not single studs)
- Used 4 lag bolts (not 2) with structural washers
- Load-tested with 300 lbs before tile (passed)
- **Cost:** +$120 vs. standard bench

## Accessibility Features Detail

### Grab Bar Placement Strategy

**Entry Grab Bar (Horizontal):**
- Location: Adjacent to entry, outside shower
- Height: 33-36 inches (ADA range)
- Length: 24 inches
- Purpose: Stability entering/exiting

**Bench Grab Bars (L-Configuration):**
- Vertical bar: 18 inches, starts at 33" height
- Horizontal bar: 24 inches, at 36" height
- Purpose: Transfer assistance (standing ↔ sitting)

**Control Wall Grab Bar (Vertical):**
- Location: 12 inches from shower valve
- Height: 33-48 inches
- Purpose: Balance while adjusting water

**All grab bars:**
- 1.25" diameter (ADA compliant, easier grip than 1.5")
- 300+ lb weight rating
- Brushed nickel (matches fixtures)
- Installed into 2x8 blocking (not drywall anchors)

### Fold-Down Bench Details

**Moen Home Care DN8390**
- Size: 18" wide x 14" deep (folded = 2.5" protrusion)
- Height: 17-19 inches (ADA transfer height range)
- Weight capacity: 500 lbs
- Surface: Textured white phenolic (slip-resistant when wet)
- Installation: 4 lag bolts into double blocking

**Why fold-down vs. built-in?**
- Saves space when not in use (wheelchair turning room)
- Easier to clean shower floor
- Modern aesthetic (vs. tile bench)
- **Cost:** $420 vs. $280 for tile bench (worth it for function)

### Thermostatic Valve (Anti-Scald)

**Kohler K-T98761-4**
- Maintains set temperature (±2°F)
- Auto shutoff if cold water fails (prevents scalding)
- Volume + temperature independent controls
- **Why critical for elderly:**
  - Slower reaction time (can't quickly adjust if too hot)
  - Thinner skin (burns easier)
  - Medication effects (reduced sensation)

**Code requirement:** New Jersey requires thermostatic or pressure-balanced valves in all showers (IRC 2018)

## Client Feedback

> "I cried when I saw it finished—happy tears. Mom showered by herself for the first time in 6 months. She said, 'I feel like a person again, not a patient.' The bench is perfect, the grab bars are exactly where she needs them, and she loves the rain shower. Best money we've ever spent. Mom's staying in her home!"  
> — Patricia, daughter (Somers Point, NJ)

**From the Client (Mom):**

> "I was scared this would look like a hospital shower. It's beautiful! My friends come over just to see it. I feel safe, I can bathe independently, and I actually enjoy my shower again. The handheld spray makes washing my feet so easy. Thank you for giving me my dignity back."  
> — Dorothy, 78 (Somers Point, NJ)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

---

## Technical Highlights

### Slope Engineering

**Challenge:** Gradual enough for wheelchair, steep enough to drain

**Solution:**
- First 24 inches from drain: 1/3" per foot slope (aggressive drainage)
- Middle 24 inches: 1/4" per foot slope (standard)
- Transition 12 inches: Gradual ramp < 1:12 ratio (ADA max)

**Verification method:**
- 4-foot level with 1" block = proper 1/4" per foot
- Water test (pour 2 gallons, watch flow - should reach drain in < 10 seconds)

### Waterproofing for Curbless

**Why it's more critical:**
- Water spreads wider (no curb containment)
- Transition area gets wet (must be waterproof)
- Higher volume at drain (flood risk if leak)

**Extra waterproofing steps:**
1. Extended membrane 12 inches beyond shower footprint
2. Waterproofed entire transition zone
3. Double-sealed drain flange
4. 48-hour flood test (vs. standard 24 hours)

**Result:** Zero leaks, zero call-backs

### Universal Design Principles

**What worked for wheelchair also works for everyone:**

✅ **Zero threshold** = Easy for kids, pets, cleaning  
✅ **Handheld shower** = Washing kids, pets, shower walls  
✅ **Bench** = Shaving legs, tired after workout, sitting  
✅ **Grab bars** = Everyone uses them (admitted or not)  
✅ **Better lighting** = Safer for all ages  

**Resale value:** Aging-in-place features increase home value 3-7% (AARP study)

## Lessons Learned

### For Homeowners

**1. Insurance May Cover Accessibility**
- Patricia's insurance paid $5,000 (medical necessity)
- Requires doctor's note + pre-approval
- Covers safety features, not "luxury" upgrades
- **Saved:** $5,000

**2. Curbless ≠ Disabled-Looking**
- Modern design can be stunning AND accessible
- Subway tile + marble = spa aesthetic
- Brushed nickel grab bars = stylish, not institutional

**3. Plan for Wider Needs**
- Wheelchair access benefits everyone
- Aging-in-place beats assisted living cost
- **Math:** $15,880 renovation vs. $6,000/month assisted living = Break-even in 3 months

**4. Structural Work Adds Cost**
- Lowering floor = +$2,400 (labor + materials)
- But necessary for proper curbless installation
- **Don't skip:** Cutting corners = failed curbless (water damage)

### For Contractors

**1. Verify Floor Depth BEFORE Quoting**
- Remove small section to measure
- Don't trust plans (homes settle, joists vary)
- **This project:** 8" actual vs. 10" assumed = redesign needed

**2. Linear Drains Front-Loaded Better**
- Wheelchair users benefit
- Easier sloping (water flows away from entry)
- **Standard:** Back of shower, **Better:** Front or center

**3. Bench Blocking = Critical**
- Must support 500+ lbs (transfer forces)
- Double 2x8 blocking minimum
- Four lag bolts, not two

**4. Glass Panel Strategic Placement**
- 24" width at entry = splash containment
- Positioned to block spray, not entry path
- **Mistake:** Full glass door defeats curbless purpose
